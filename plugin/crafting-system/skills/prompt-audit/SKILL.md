# Prompt Audit

Audit the provided prompt or prompt target: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Instructions

1. Identify the prompt's intended surface: Claude chat, Claude API, Claude Code, skill, plugin, subagent, or MCP workflow.
2. Separate facts, assumptions, recommendations, unknowns, and blockers.
3. Check for:
 - clear objective
 - role and responsibility boundaries
 - source-first behavior
 - risk gate and ask-vs-act boundary
 - tool-use trigger rules
 - context layout
 - XML or schema structure
 - examples and edge cases
 - output contract
 - validation/evaluation plan
 - contradictory instructions
 - over-prompting or under-specification
4. Do not rewrite the whole prompt unless the user asks. First produce findings.
