# Risk Gate

Assess this task: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Instructions

Score each dimension 0 to 3:

- reversibility
- external impact
- uncertainty
- validation availability
- permission sensitivity

Then choose one decision:

- proceed
- inspect_sources
- ask_minimum_input
- plan_only
- stop
- refuse

Ask only for missing input that is blocking. Do not ask for information already available in source material.
